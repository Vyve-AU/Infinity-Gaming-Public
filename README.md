## What is this repository about?
Are you an Infinity Gaming community member that would like to submit code or scripts for us to use on our FiveM server? Great! You can do so by submitting code through pull requests on this repository.

The idea behind this system is to allow community developers to take part in the development of the server and make submissions to improve our FiveM server together.

## What content can I submit?
You may submit content that meets the following criteria:
1. Content that is either solely owned by you, yourself; or, content that under license is permitted to be used within our FiveM server environment, and submitted under correct open-source policies.
2. Content that completely adheres to FiveM rules, guidelines or terms of service. ([Cfx.re Platform Service Agreement](https://runtime.fivem.net/fivem-service-agreement-4.pdf))
3. Content that does not include locked, obfuscated, minified or otherwise built or scrambled material.
4. Content that is well commented, readable and up to expected quality standards of development.
5. Content that contains links to source material, documentation and credit to original authors if permitted.

## What is the approval process for content submitted?
After a submission is made and the code for the submission is reviewed - the submission will be brought to our Community Advisory Committee for further review and discussion of its gameplay impact and viability.
If approved by the Community Advisory Committee - you will be contacted privately by a senior member of our development team whom which will discuss improvements that may need to be made and discussion on further implementation.

## Can pull requests be created to improve existing content within this repository?
